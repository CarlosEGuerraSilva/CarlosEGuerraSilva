Hey! Hi, i am a Full-Stack developer, CEO of Expringsoft, where I am currently developing a flagship project to officially introduce ourselves. I love programming, currently my focus is on web development, but I also enjoy building desktop applications in C# for Windows or multiplatform with .NET MAUI. I also love play videogames, you may can find me as MajesticScarab8 (or X instead of 8) on multiple games and platforms, such Xbox, Epic, Minecraft.

### Languages that I use on projects.

</div>

###### *Shell may not be a language but if you keep reading you will understand why is there.
###### *I have small knowledge of C, C++, Go and Dart, but that was long ago, they don't count here but I could learn them fast.
###### *I hate Java, can work with it only if the pay is good enough.

# About me
>Software development has contributed to the solution of endless problems and needs, automating processes, reducing times, improving efficiency, and at the same time, each software has multiple opportunities for improvement and efficiency, this is where my story as a developer begins.

As a child I used to use my father's computer, although I usually played, I also liked to experiment with the different programs that he had installed, I always found things that I thought could be better, a solution to something, a design change, I always thought there were many ways to make something better, more useful, more fun. Halfway through high school (here in Mexico known as "secundaria," taken by 12 to 15 year olds) I began to study on my own how to develop Android apps, back then with Java, although that first foray was not successful, I took the world of programming as a real challenge. In my last year of high school was when I started learning C#, this time to develop a desktop app on Windows, Lydia: a Voice Assistant, which over the years I climbed with functions that complemented my learning and that I used in my day to day, at the same time that I returned to the development of apps with Android, this time with the concepts learned I managed to create several gallery applications, notes, etc. Since high school I have gone to different competitions, when I entered the University I started going to hackathons and state competitions, in some of them obtaining first place, for a time I developed Augmented Reality apps and ventured into 3D modeling, currently I have moved away from that because I enjoy software development more.

Nowadays I mainly work as a full stack developer, working on small private projects, as well as custom development for different businesses and small companies, inventory controls, POS, e-commerce, landing pages, management systems, etc.

# About Expringsoft and what's coming
Expringsoft was a small project that I started for custom development, starting with a simple project management and notes system, to become a complete control system to manage the different developments that I have done, now becoming my development startup.
For now it is just me, but I consider expanding the members to cover different areas, create job opportunities and offer better solutions in a better time and form, always looking to create something bigger.
### MiraiForge
MiraiForge is our first and next big product as Expringsoft, I don't want to go into details for now, but it's something that has been planned and developed for a long time and I think it has huge potential to improve the experience of many people, expect news very soon.
